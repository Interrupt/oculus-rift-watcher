# oculus-rift-watcher
In stock checker for the Oculus Rift S.

Build the app yourself via `go build`, or download the oculuswatcher.exe application from Releases.

Usage: run the executable, it will check the Oculus Rift S website or any changes to the 'Buy' button, and play an alert sound if there is an 'alert.mp3' file next to the executable.

Happy hunting!
